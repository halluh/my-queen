<h1> THE QUEEN HOLDING MY CROWN </h1>
<img src="zamzam/queen.jpg">
<p> It was in 2016 when a beautiful chemistry was built between me and queen. Ever known someone; a complete stranger for that matter then just like that you click and become more than sisters. When in my low moments a conversation with her rejuvinates me just like a an almost-dying patient getting out safely from ICU. As an unbelievable as it sounds; it's  as purely-honest as it feels in the most honest part of us:THE HEART.</p>
